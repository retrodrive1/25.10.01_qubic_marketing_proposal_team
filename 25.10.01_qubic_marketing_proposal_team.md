### **Executive Summary: A Lean, High-Performance Team**

The marketing team has undergone a complete and necessary restructuring
over the past four months. We now present a highly active, professional
and cohesive unit that is experienced in Qubic\'s narrative and
technology and remains fundamentally budget-conscious.

The current proposal reflects the scale of activities required to seize
momentum, accelerate adoption, and position Qubic as a category leader.

Most critically, this plan introduces a much-needed CMO to the team,
which will allow us to immediately fill gaps in our strategy based on
user behavior metrics.

### **Team Reorganization and Cost Efficiency**

The primary goal of the reorganization was to maximize output and
efficiency while driving down expenses. This focused effort has resulted
in significant cost savings and capacity expansion:

-   **Design and Creative Cost Reduction:** The previous arrangement
    with an external Marketing Agency plus Broms, costing \$9,000 per
    month, has been replaced by a streamlined Designer Team plus
    Tokenoya at a monthly cost of only \$3,000. This represents a
    substantial reduction in overhead for core creative services.

-   **New Leadership and Core Commitment:** **Stephanie Nicolich
    (DeFiMomma)** replaces Jen King. Stephanie is a highly active and
    experienced marketer whose dedication to Qubic's success extends
    beyond a typical job role. She brings a fresh vision for growth
    and accountability, with her work already receiving glowing
    internal reviews.

-   **Expanded Capacity for Strategic Focus:** To relieve the excessive
    workload on Griz (who was managing all graphics, website
    redesigns, and academy build-out), an additional designer has been
    tasked specifically with all Social Media graphics for a very fair
    fee. This targeted addition ensures Griz can focus on
    high-priority strategic development while maintaining timely
    delivery of daily visual assets.

## **Scope of Work for the Next 2 Months: Building Qubic\'s Growth Engine**

The \$59,700 requested is dedicated to covering the next two months of
the marketing team\'s operations. This funding will ensure continuity
for all technical and content initiatives while primarily establishing a
sustainable, always-on growth engine designed to drive adoption,
community activation, and mainstream visibility.

### **1. Leadership, Accountability, and Strategic Direction**

-   **CMO Oversight:** Provide high-level oversight to align all
    short-term campaigns (like OKX) with Qubic's long-term adoption
    goals, enforce accountability across all teams, and ensure every
    initiative is tied to measurable growth metrics.

-   **Establish Marketing Accountability & Cohesion:** Implement full
    transparency by tracking everything, including sign-ups,
    engagement, and conversions. We will establish clear ownership and
    deadlines across all functions and conduct regular sprint reviews
    to align team output with top-line growth goals.

-   **Adaptable Operations:** Stay fluid and adaptable within Qubic's
    decentralized and fast-moving ecosystem, plugging into gaps,
    filling needs, and leading with the intention that every dollar
    spent drives people to the next step in Qubic's journey.

### **2. CRM & Tech Stack Transition**

-   **System Migration:** Transitioning from the expensive and
    underutilized HubSpot platform to a leaner, more cost-effective
    system.

-   **Automation:** Integrate essential third-party social automation
    tools (ManyChat, Discord bots, and scheduling platforms). This
    shift reduces overhead while improving campaign scalability and
    intentional automation.

### **3. Paid Marketing & Precision Scaling**

-   **Targeted Campaigns:** Fuel experimental and retargeting campaigns
    across X, LinkedIn, Meta, and potential partnerships to expand
    reach, drive conversions, and refine our audience targeting.

-   **Budget Reallocation:** Reallocate budgets by replacing costly
    tools with a lean, best-in-class stack, saving approximately
    \$1,000/month. These savings will be invested directly into
    retargeting and geo-targeted ads in high-performing regions.

-   **A/B Testing Framework:** Launch a dedicated A/B testing framework
    for creative, copy, and incentive framing to consistently improve
    advertising ROI.

### **4. Community Activation and Growth Flywheels**

-   **Community Flywheel Model:** Convert Discord's 60,000+ members from
    passive participants into measurable growth assets by building
    exclusivity and rewarding loyalty.

-   **ManyChat Sequences on X:** Implement auto-onboarding sequences for
    new followers that drive email opt-ins and DM news/updates,
    establishing an Always-On Growth Engine.

-   **Discord Activation:** Introduce an Investor Access Channel
    (pinned, gated form) for insider email updates, creating an "Qubic
    Insider's Club." We will also introduce Status & Recognition Roles
    (Investor, Insider, Ambassador) tied to email subscription and
    engagement, creating gamified recognition.

-   **Social Outreach:** Execute organic amplification strategies,
    partnership activations, and community management across Discord
    and X, ensuring Qubic dominates conversations in target regions.

### **5. Content, Design, and The Qubic Media Machine**

-   **Content & Editorial Function:** Led by Peter, this function acts
    as the conductor of all content. This involves drafting blogs,
    amplifying scientific insights, and transforming every Qubic
    update into multi-channel narratives across blog, X, Discord, and
    newsletters.

-   **Qubic Digital Newsroom:** Oversee a central hub to repurpose every
    milestone into X threads, Discord announcements, LinkedIn
    articles, emails, and blog posts.

-   **Evergreen Funnels:** Build automated email sequences and DM
    campaigns that nurture, educate, and activate users 24/7.

-   **Design & Creative Execution:** Dedicated creative resources will
    deliver graphics, video editing, and branded assets essential for
    supporting all campaigns, announcements, events, and community
    engagement.

## **Key Achievements and Deliverables (Past 4 Months)**

Despite operating on an extremely limited budget (4 months operation on
3 months budget), the team delivered significantly more than promised,
successfully restructured operations, and reduced future expenses.

**Content & Public Relations (PR) Impact**

-   **High-Volume Content:** Delivered 21 Blog articles, averaging two
    per week (Scientific Advisory Team articles excluded).

-   **Media Outreach and Narrative Control:** Executed a successful
    press release on the Monero narrative, resulting in over 700
    publications and many more organic articles. We engaged directly
    with news outlets to adjust the narrative and tracked results for
    profitability.

-   **Routine Communications:** With collaboration with Ambassadors
    (Popeye and Kimz), initiated the Qubic bi-weekly newsletter.

-   **Social Media Growth:** Achieved multiple daily X posts with a
    significant increase in impressions and overall engagement.
    Successfully restarted posting and maintenance on the LinkedIn
    Qubic page.

**Technical Marketing and Integrations**

-   **Data Integration (Completed):** Successfully integrated Revenue
    Tracking with DeFiLlama.

-   **Compliance (Ongoing):** Initiated the ongoing CertiK score upgrade
    process(w/Joetom). We are currently in the process of onboarding
    the Qubic dev team for KYC procedure and adding the Bug Bounty
    information. Both will significantly improve Qubics Cartik score
    and place it on the first page of results.

-   **Data Integration (Ongoing):** Initiated the process for
    integrating Qubic mining statistics with WhatToMine.com (w/Dkat).
    Currently in line for integration.

**Campaign and Development Execution**

-   **OKX Signups:** Assisted the team to successfully execute mass paid
    advertising on X and strategic marketing, resulting in a
    quantifiable increase in user applications.

-   **Token 2049 Conference:** Assisted the team to provide
    comprehensive marketing support including graphics, videos,
    promotions, full booth design and a full e-mail campaign to hit
    the goal of Qubic event signups.

-   **Core Development Support:** Delivered the Governance web page and
    video, which serves as a signaling future design standard for the
    main Qubic website.

What we are offering to build in just 2 months is a lot. We believe that
this will significantly increase the engagement with the Qubic brand and
ecosystem. Vote "yes" for the team that truly cares and performs.
